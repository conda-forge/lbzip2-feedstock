# gnulib-tool is needed to generate the ./configure - it is supposed to be picked up as source
# and included in applications:
#
# From: https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/
#
#   Gnulib is a central location for common GNU code, intended to be shared among GNU packages.
#   GCC has libiberty, but this is hard to disentangle from the GCC build tree.
#
#   Gnulib takes a different approach. Its components are intended to be shared at the source level,
#Â   rather than being a library that gets built, installed, and linked against. Thus, there is no
#   distribution tarball; the idea is to copy files from Gnulib into your own source tree.
